#Proposal

## What will (probably) be the title of your project?

Zyro

## In one or two sentences, summarize your project. (For example, "A website that allows you to buy and sell stocks.")

A program that is like the game of Tetris, because with pixels you can make it

## In one paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it run?

The feature it will have will be that it will be easy to use, it will have its scoreboard and everything

## If you plan to combine the final project of 1051 with the final project of another course, with which other course? And what aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051 and what aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I'm not applying to another course

## If you plan to collaborate with 1-2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned assistants below.

Only I do.

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer than expected to implement. So it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a set amount of time than you expect.

### In one sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. That is, what will you accomplish no matter what?

If everything goes as I think I can make the game open and when you want to restart it just a button press will do.

### In one sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. That is, what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project deadline?

If it goes well and all and I think I'm exaggerating is that tetris has autosave ### In one sentence (or list of features), define the BEST outcome for your final project. That is, what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project deadline?

Same as the last question ## In one paragraph or more, describe your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Create the scenario like the score table above, the rectangle where the blocks will fall, the topics I will cover are like merging files and I will not be working with people
